###My webpage
####Laura Brooks

1. I think that my design is simple and easy to understand. I think I did a good job with the constants that stay on each page (header and nav bar), but I got a bit confused with the sections of each page that were similar, but not exactly the same. I think my css could be a bit better in these area--and I'll work on neatening that in the future. Also I will edit everything to make it viewable on mobile and other device sizes.

2. Nitesh Gupta helped me out a lot with figuring out how to use git. He also explained permissions and how to link to my cs.tufts.edu site. Marcy Regalado helped me with some styling advice and we worked out some css together.

3. I spent a lot of time on this assignment--both figuring out how to best use HTML/CSS and styling. I got really into it and re-started when I didn't like my original layout. Total I probably spent 15-20 hours.
